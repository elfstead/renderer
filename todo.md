- test that I can access: example: make screen color be the coordinates of the first vert
- try to draw only a single triangle or only a single mesh
- print out everything i send to gpu

- try some diff approaches for the light calc func. like why is it ever nega? just try some basic shit and make it more cooler after

- why is frametime sometimes 0 and sometimes double? race condition?
